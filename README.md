# Alafia
Sharable Culturally-Aware Mosaics Based on your Mood
> By: Diego Serrano Martello, John Fitzgerald, Joshua Shiman and Joel Lawrence

Alafia (derived from the Yoruba word for “peace”) is the new way to connect with inspiring role models, leaders and creative works tailored to BIPOC users’ identities. Black communities are underrepresented in mainstream mentorship, media, and leadership, leaving many without culturally resonant role models, which is why we built Alafia. Through a generative AI-powered webapp, you can generate curated and bespoke Mosaics that:

- 📊 Integrate culturally relevant trends using multi-source APIs to ensure representation aligns with real-world data
- 📝 Deliver bespoke content through AI sentiment analysis and NLP, prioritizing accuracy and cultural resonance
- 💿 Recommend multimedia resources (films, books, music) to inspire users with actionable role models
